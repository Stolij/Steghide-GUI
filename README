Steghide-GUI is an unofficial graphical frontend for steghide written in Qt. 
steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide data in various kinds of image- and audio-files. The color and sample-frequencies are not changed thus making the embedding resistant against first-order statistical tests. 

HOW TO COMPILE AND INSTALL:

Required packages: qmake libmhash-dev libmcrypt-dev

To generate makefile just create folder where you wants to build and use command:
	qmake -spec linux-g++ -o Makefile ../Steghide-GUI/Steghide-GUI.pro
	
Where last path is the path to the .pro file from the Steghide-GUI source;

After you generate the makefile just type:
	make
	
to build it and get compiled Steghide-GUI binary (Run ./Steghide-GUI).

If you want to install Steghide-GUI via 'make install' after the 'make' command add these lines in *.pro files and repeat all commands listed above (in this example the installation path will be /usr/local/bin/):
	target.path = /usr/local/bin/
	INSTALLS += target

LAZY WAY: Just install QT Creator and open the .pro file ;)
